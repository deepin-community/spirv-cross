Description: tool designed for parsing and converting SPIR-V to other shader languages
 SPIRV-Cross is a tool designed for parsing and converting SPIR-V to other
 shader languages:
  * Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient GLSL
  * Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient MSL
  * Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient HLSL
  * Reflection API to simplify the creation of Vulkan pipeline layouts
  * Reflection API to modify and tweak OpDecorations
  * Supports "all" of vertex, fragment, tessellation, geometry and
      compute shaders
